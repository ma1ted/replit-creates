            <p>fact 1: no paper planes are allowed to be thrown - it could take someone's eye out.</p><br />
            <p>fact 2: astronauts who have walked in space say it smells like wet dog and dijon mustard.</p><br />
            <p>fact 3: the average person spends about 1 light year in space before it is time for the next person.</p><br />
            <p>fact 4: sometimes.</p><br />

            <p>fact 10: although it's called space there isn't a lot of space above earth because there's a ton of detritus floating in the sky. management have asked if it would be okay if people could use the litter bins provided instead of depositing their shite in low earth orbit, cheers.</p>
